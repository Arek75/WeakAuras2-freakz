# WeakAuras 2

WeakAuras is a powerful and flexible framework that allows you to display highly customizable graphics on your screen to indicate buffs, debuffs, and a whole host of similar types of information. It was originally meant to be a lightweight replacement for Power Auras, but it now incorporates many features that Power Auras does not, while still remaining more efficient and easy to use.

Features include:

* An intuitive and powerful configuration interface
* Custom textures including all textures from Power Auras and the new Cataclysm spell alerts
* Progress bars and textures that show the exact duration of auras
* Displays based on auras, health, power (mana, rage, soul shards, holy power, etc.), cooldowns, combat events, runes, totems, items, and many other triggers
* Preset and user-defined animations
* Custom side-effects such as chat announcements or sounds
* Grouping, which allows multiple displays to be positioned and configured at the same time
* CPU optimizations such as conditional loading/unloading of displays, modularity, and prevention of full aura scanning
* Powerful customization options, such as animation paths, on-show/on-hide code, and custom triggers, for Lua-savvy users

To open the options window, type `/wa` or `/weakauras` into your chat and hit enter or use the LDB feed.

## Extending WeakAuras 2

* [WeakAuras_StopMotion](https://www.wowace.com/addons/weakauras-stop-motion): This addon adds a new region type to WeakAuras that allows for stop motion animations. Stop Motion textures contain each frame of the animation as a separate image. The addon ships with a number of animations and it supports custom textures.
* [SharedMedia](https://www.wowace.com/addons/sharedmedia) for more bar textures.
* [SharedMediaAdditionalFonts](https://www.wowace.com/addons/shared-media-additional-fonts) for more fonts.
* [ColorPickerPlus](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/colorpickerplus) for a better version of the WoW color picker that includes class color templates and a copy and paste function.
